# 6502-Assembly
Useful programs and subroutines.

I have been programming in 6502 Assembly language as a hobby since 1982.  During that time I have had the pleasure of discovering and creating some small programs and subroutines that I have found useful.  Some have been forever lost, but my aim here is to collect and share the remainder of my work, in the hopes that it may be useful (or at least mildly entertaining) to others.

This collection spans many years, and many different assemblers.  I will attempt to translate all of the non-trivial examples to a common format, that of the Kowalski Simulator, a presently maintained version of which can be freely downloaded from:  https://sbc.rictor.org/kowalski.html -- Many thanks to Daryl Rictor for his efforts.

This is my first attempt at creating a repository, so there will be a learning curve, with associated delays.  I can almost guarantee that mistakes will be made, so please bear with me.  Also, please don't hesitate to ask any questions or provide any critiques and comments, constructive or otherwise.  I can be reached privately by appending @yahoo.com to my user name.

Thank you so much for visiting.
